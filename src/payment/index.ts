 * Payment channels are generally used as a mechanism to increase the scalability of blockchains and enable users to transact without involving
 * (i.e., publishing their transactions on) the blockchain, which: i) increases the load of the system, and ii) incurs gas costs for the user.
 * For more information about payment channels on Filecoin, please refer to the {@link https://spec.filecoin.io/systems/filecoin_token/payment_channels|docs} or this {@link https://www.evernote.com/shard/s10/client/snv?noteGuid=135ecd3b-b743-4f6d-8943-e9c381fbf7df&noteKey=51f2120ace7d6ed6&sn=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evernote.com%2Fshard%2Fs10%2Fsh%2F135ecd3b-b743-4f6d-8943-e9c381fbf7df%2F51f2120ace7d6ed6&title=Filecoin%2527s%2Bexisting%2Bpayment%2Bchannels%2B-%2BFilecoin%2BRetrieval%2BMarket%2B-%2BConfluence|article}
